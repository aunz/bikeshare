# Bike turnover

We want to make sure that in each station, there are enough bikes so whenever users want a bike, there should be a free one to take and when a user returns a bike, there should be an empty rack.

We assume that in each station, when a bike is taken out of a rack ðŸ”“, there will be an empty "slot" which can be filled by another incoming bike ðŸ”’. So on average, the number of "out" bikes should cancel out the number of "in" bikes.

But we find a different pattern

- in Station Bay St / Wellesley St W, **2733** more bikes were taken out than anticipated
- in Union Station, **3006** more bikes were put in than anticipated


## Union Station
Let's have a closer look at Union Station. We will determine the kind of event (-1: bike taken out, 1: bike put back in), number of event (n) and the time range. Such as below

|| event | n | from | to | duration (sec) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | -1 | 2 | 2016-01-10 00:10:00 | 2016-01-10 00:13:00 |180
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 2016-01-10 00:20:03 | 2016-01-10 00:20:03 | 0
| 3 | -1 | 1 | 2016-01-10 00:58:00 | 2016-01-10 00:58:00 | 0
| 4 | 1 | 3 | 2016-01-10 01:04:27 | 2016-01-10 01:20:11 | 944

The table shows that from 00:10:00 to 00:13:00 (3 minutes), 2 bikes were taken out. This is followed at 00:20:03 where 1 bike was put back in.

By tallying up these events, we found that:
- From 2016-03-10 18:29:07 to 2016-03-10 20:54:48 (146 minutes) 38 bikes were put in continuously with no bike being taken out. Mmm, there must be at least 38 racks at the station ðŸ¤”?
- From 2016-06-10 11:20:00 to 2016-06-10 11:58:00 (38 minutes) 19 bikes were taken out continuously. So at least there must be 19 racks too.

The data is not complete, there are many periods when nothing happened ðŸ˜£.
